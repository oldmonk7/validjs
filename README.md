ValidJS - Form fields validation library for JavaScript

It includes the basic validation for all form items and it uses regular expressions to validate.

###Usage



Valid instantiates itself onto the window. This means you can use it right away by including it in the the script tag and use an instance of Valid immediately.

```html
<!-- Load Valid -->
<script src="valid.js"></script>
<script>
    // Use instantly, Object created itself!
    console.log(valid.validateName("MyValidName"); // returns true
    console.log(valid.validateEmail("email@github.c"); // returns false	
</script>
```
